# bevy_ui_builder
This is my preferred way of creating UI. It is based loosely on [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) and uses bevy's ecs and bevy's built-in ui.
## Warning
This is in very early development, use at your own risk. At the moment there is little/no documentation.

There is going to be a change from Component based to Event based (See https://github.com/aevyrie/bevy_eventlistener/tree/main).
# Usage
Right now this works with bevy version 0.11


Add `bevy_ui_builder = { git = "https://github.com/badcodecat/bevy_ui_builder.git" }` to your Cargo.toml.


There are some samples of how to use this in the examples directory.
